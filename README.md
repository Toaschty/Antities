## About the Simulation

Antities is a software application that simulates the behavior of ants in a 'realistic' way.

Developed with Unity and the Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) version 1.0, the ants' behavior closely mimics their natural counterparts, including the use of pheromones to mark paths to their colony or food sources.

The simulation is fully interactive, allowing users to edit the terrain by utilizing the Marching Cubes algorithm to create unique landscapes. Settings related to ant behavior and pathfinding can be adjusted during the process for a customizable experience.

## Running the Program

### Executable File

The latest build for Windows can be downloaded directly under [Releases](https://github.com/Toaschty/Antities/releases).

### Building the Project

Alternatively, the source code can be obtained via this repository:

`git clone git@github.com:Toaschty/Antities.git`

or

`git clone https://github.com/Toaschty/Antities.git`

To avoid compatibility issues, it is strongly recommended to use Unity version **2022.3.7f1** or newer.
Since Unity DOTS is still under active development, **version 1.0** should be used whenever possible. Older or future versions may include significant changes to its functionality.
